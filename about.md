## About this blog
This blog is a personal collection of thoughts in writing of Nathaniel Budijono (me), known on github as nathanielbd.

Here, I'll write about some things I like or don't like about the world and stuff I've learned along the way while teaching myself.

Functional programming, reversible computing, history memes, protein structure prediction, and text adventure games are all fair game.

All views expressed are entirely my own.

## About me
I'm an autodidact, aspiring computational STEMer, student, and programmer. Probably in that order.

More about me on my [personal website](http://nathanielbd.github.io).
