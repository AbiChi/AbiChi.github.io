## About
This is a site I will use to document various projects of mine. Some are done solo, others will be links to projects I have participated in. Thank you for visiting!

### Navigation menu
Starting from the 1.1.0 version, the links inside the navigation menu are autogenerated from pages having the layout set to ``page``.
You can set custom links, by putting in the ``<a>`` tag into the ``link.html`` file.

### Branch
Emerald has two branch: 
- ``master``: is for developing purposes.
- ``gh-pages``: is only for demo site.  

### Baseurl
Emerald was thought to be used mainly with Github, in particular into [project site](https://pages.github.com/). For this reason several tags have been included ``{{ site.baseurl }}`` to refer to the "/emerald/" directory.
You can change the "baseurl" value into the ``config.yml`` file, to match your directory (for example "/blog/") or the root of your project. In that case you must set the "baseurl" value to "/".

Last but not least: the [Jekyll documentation](http://jekyllrb.com) is the best starting point!
